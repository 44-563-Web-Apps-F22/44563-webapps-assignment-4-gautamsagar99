        Same Scene. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN discovered singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a mandolin. LITTLE BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at him.

        <p class="song">
SONG—CAPTAIN Fair moon, to thee I sing, Bright regent of the heavens, Say, why is everything Either at sixes or at sevens? I have lived hitherto Free from breath of slander, Beloved by all my crew— A really popular commander. But now my kindly crew rebel, My daughter to a tar is partial, Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell, He threatens a court martial! Fair moon, to thee I sing, Bright regent of the heavens, Say, why is everything Either at sixes or at sevens?

<h5 class="butname">BUT,</h5>
Things are seldom what they seem, Skim milk masquerades as cream; Highlows pass as patent leathers; Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.
<h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>
<p class="directions">(puzzled).</p>

Very true, So they do.
<h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5>
Black sheep dwell in every fold; All that glitters is not gold; Storks turn out to be but logs; Bulls are but inflated frogs.
<h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>
<p class="directions">(puzzled).</p>

So they be, Frequentlee.
<h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5>
Drops the wind and stops the mill; Turbot is ambitious brill; Gild the farthing if you will, Yet it is a farthing still.
<h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>

Yes, I know. That is so. Though to catch your drift I'm striving, It is shady—it is shady; I don't see at what you're driving, Mystic lady—mystic lady.
(Aside.)

Stern conviction's o'er me stealing, That the mystic lady's dealing In oracular revealing.

Though I'm anything but clever, I could talk like that for ever: Once a cat was killed by care; Only brave deserve the fair. Very true, So they do.

Wink is often good as nod; Spoils the child who spares the rod; Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers; Dogs are found in many mangers.
<h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5>
Frequentlee, I agree. Paw of cat the chestnut snatches; Worn-out garments show new patches; Only count the chick that hatches; Men are grown-up catchy-catchies.
<h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5>
Yes, I know, That is so.
(Aside.)

  <p>Same Scene. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN
    discovered
         singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
    mandolin. LITTLE
         BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
    him.
  <p class="song">
                              SONG—CAPTAIN
  
                        Fair moon, to thee I sing,
                          Bright regent of the heavens,
                        Say, why is everything
                          Either at sixes or at sevens?
                        I have lived hitherto
                          Free from breath of slander,
                        Beloved by all my crew—
                          A really popular commander.
                        But now my kindly crew rebel,
                          My daughter to a tar is partial,
                        Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell,
                          He threatens a court martial!
                           Fair moon, to thee I sing,
                             Bright regent of the heavens,
                           Say, why is everything
                             Either at sixes or at sevens?
  </p>
  <p>
          BUT. How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the
    unconscious
    moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may
    be! Who is
    poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall
    on one so
    lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!
          CAPT. <p class="directions">(coming down).</p> Ah! Little Buttercup, still on board?
    That is
    not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable
    to have
    gone on shore at dusk.
          BUT, True, dear Captain—but the recollection of your sad
    pale
    face seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile
    before I
    go.
          CAPT. Ah! Little Buttercup, I fear it will be long before I
    recover my accustomed cheerfulness, for misfortunes crowd upon
    me, and
    all my old friends seem to have turned against me!
          BUT, Oh no—do not say "all", dear Captain. That were
    unjust to
    one, at least.
          CAPT. True, for you are staunch to me. <p class="directions"> (Aside.)</p> If ever I
    gave my
    heart again, methinks it would be to such a one as this! <p class="directions">(Aloud.)</p> 
    I am
    touched to the heart by your innocent regard for me, and were we
    differently situated, I think I could have returned it. But as it
    is, I
    fear I can never be more to you than a friend.
          BUT, I understand! You hold aloof from me because you are
    rich and
    lofty—and I poor and lowly. But take care! The poor bumboat
    woman has
    gipsy blood in her veins, and she can read destinies.
          CAPT. Destinies?
          BUT. There is a change in store for you!
          CAPT. A change?
          BUT. Aye—be prepared!
      </p>
      <p>
                       DUET—LITTLE BUTTERCUP and CAPTAIN
  
     <h5 class="butname">BUT, </h5>     
     <p class="BUT">  
     Things are seldom what they seem,
                   Skim milk masquerades as cream;
                   Highlows pass as patent leathers;
                   Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.</p>  
      <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5> <p class="directions">(puzzled).</p> <p class="CAP"> Very true,
                       So they do.</p>
      <h5 class="butname">BUT. </h5>       <p class="BUT"> Black sheep dwell in every fold;
                   All that glitters is not gold;
                   Storks turn out to be but logs;
                     Bulls are but inflated frogs.</p>
     <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>  <p class="directions">(puzzled).</p> <p class="CAP"> So they be,
                        Frequentlee.</p>
     <h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5>      <p class="BUT">    Drops the wind and stops the mill;
                   Turbot is ambitious brill;
                   Gild the farthing if you will,
                   Yet it is a farthing still.</p>
      <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5> <p class="directions">(puzzled).</p> <p class="CAP"> Yes, I know.
                       That is so.
                   Though to catch your drift I'm striving,
                     It is shady—it is shady;
                   I don't see at what you're driving,
                     Mystic lady—mystic lady.</p>
      <p class="directions">(Aside.)</p>   <p class="CAP">  Stern conviction's o'er me stealing,
                   That the mystic lady's dealing
                   In oracular revealing.</p>
      <h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5> <p class="directions">(aside).</p> <p class="BUT"> Stern conviction's o'er him stealing,
                   That the mystic lady's dealing
                   In oracular revealing.
                           Yes, I know—
                           That is so!</p>
      <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>     <p class="CAP">  Though I'm anything but clever,
                   I could talk like that for ever:
                   Once a cat was killed by care;
                   Only brave deserve the fair.
                           Very true,
                           So they do.</p> 
     <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>     <p class="CAP">   Wink is often good as nod;
                   Spoils the child who spares the rod;
                   Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers;
                   Dogs are found in many mangers.</p> 
     <h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5>             <p class="BUT">    Frequentlee,
                           I agree.
                   Paw of cat the chestnut snatches;
                   Worn-out garments show new patches;
                   Only count the chick that hatches;
                   Men are grown-up catchy-catchies.</p> 
      <h5 class="butname">BUT. </h5>         <p class="BUT">      Yes, I know,
                           That is so.</p> 
      <p class="directions">(Aside.) </p>  <p class="BUT">  Though to catch my drift he's striving,
                     I'll dissemble—I'll dissemble;
                   When he sees at what I'm driving,
                     Let him tremble—let him tremble!

  <h3>ACT: II - Night , Scene: QUARTER-DECK OF H.M.S. PINAFORE, OFF PORTSMOUTH</h3>
  <p>Same Scene. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN
    discovered
    singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
    mandolin. LITTLE
    BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
    him.
  <p class="song">
    SONG—CAPTAIN

    Fair moon, to thee I sing,
    Bright regent of the heavens,
    Say, why is everything
    Either at sixes or at sevens?
    I have lived hitherto
    Free from breath of slander,
    Beloved by all my crew—
    A really popular commander.
    But now my kindly crew rebel,
    My daughter to a tar is partial,
    Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell,
    He threatens a court martial!
    Fair moon, to thee I sing,
    Bright regent of the heavens,
    Say, why is everything
    Either at sixes or at sevens?
  </p>
  <p>
  <h5 class="butname">BUT, </h5> <p class="BUT"> How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the unconscious
  moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may be! Who is
  poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall on one so lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!
</p>
  <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>
  <p class="directions">(coming down).</p>  <p class="CAP">Ah! Little Buttercup, still on board?
  That is
  not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable
  to have
  gone on shore at dusk.</p>
  
  <h5 class="butname">BUT, </h5> <p class="BUT"> True, dear Captain—but the recollection of your sad
  pale
  face seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile
  before I
  go.</p>
  <h5 class="butname">BUT, </h5> <p class="BUT"> Ah! Little Buttercup, I fear it will be long before I
  recover my accustomed cheerfulness, for misfortunes crowd upon
  me, and
  all my old friends seem to have turned against me!
  BUT, Oh no—do not say "all", dear Captain. That were
  unjust to
  one, at least.</p>
  <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5> 
  <p class="CAP">True, for you are staunch to me. <p class="directions"> (Aside.)</p> <p class="CAP">If ever I
  gave my
  heart again, methinks it would be to such a one as this!</p> <p class="directions">(Aloud.)</p>
  <p class="CAP">
  I am
  touched to the heart by your innocent regard for me, and were we
  differently situated, I think I could have returned it. But as it
  is, I
  fear I can never be more to you than a friend.</p></p>
  <h5 class="butname">BUT, </h5> <p class="BUT">I understand! You hold aloof from me because you are
  rich and
  lofty—and I poor and lowly. But take care! The poor bumboat
  woman has
  gipsy blood in her veins, and she can read destinies.</p>
  <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5> <p class="CAP">Destinies?</p>
  <h5 class="butname">BUT, </h5> <p class="BUT">There is a change in store for you!</p>
  <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5> <p class="CAP">A change?</p>
  <h5 class="butname">BUT, </h5> <p class="BUT">Aye—be prepared!</p>
  </p>
  <p>
    DUET—LITTLE BUTTERCUP and CAPTAIN

  <h5 class="butname">BUT, </h5>
  <p class="BUT">
    Things are seldom what they seem,
    Skim milk masquerades as cream;
    Highlows pass as patent leathers;
    Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.</p>
  <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>
  <p class="directions">(puzzled).</p>
  <p class="CAP"> Very true,
    So they do.</p>
  <h5 class="butname">BUT. </h5>
  <p class="BUT"> Black sheep dwell in every fold;
    All that glitters is not gold;
    Storks turn out to be but logs;
    Bulls are but inflated frogs.</p>
  <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>
  <p class="directions">(puzzled).</p>
  <p class="CAP"> So they be,
    Frequentlee.</p>
  <h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5>
  <p class="BUT"> Drops the wind and stops the mill;
    Turbot is ambitious brill;
    Gild the farthing if you will,
    Yet it is a farthing still.</p>
  <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>
  <p class="directions">(puzzled).</p>
  <p class="CAP"> Yes, I know.
    That is so.
    Though to catch your drift I'm striving,
    It is shady—it is shady;
    I don't see at what you're driving,
    Mystic lady—mystic lady.</p>
  <p class="directions">(Aside.)</p>
  <p class="CAP"> Stern conviction's o'er me stealing,
    That the mystic lady's dealing
    In oracular revealing.</p>
  <h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5>
  <p class="directions">(aside).</p>
  <p class="BUT"> Stern conviction's o'er him stealing,
    That the mystic lady's dealing
    In oracular revealing.
    Yes, I know—
    That is so!</p>
  <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>
  <p class="CAP"> Though I'm anything but clever,
    I could talk like that for ever:
    Once a cat was killed by care;
    Only brave deserve the fair.
    Very true,
    So they do.</p>
  <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>
  <p class="CAP"> Wink is often good as nod;
    Spoils the child who spares the rod;
    Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers;
    Dogs are found in many mangers.</p>
  <h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5>
  <p class="BUT"> Frequentlee,
    I agree.
    Paw of cat the chestnut snatches;
    Worn-out garments show new patches;
    Only count the chick that hatches;
    Men are grown-up catchy-catchies.</p>
  <h5 class="butname">BUT. </h5>
  <p class="BUT"> Yes, I know,
    That is so.</p>
  <p class="directions">(Aside.) </p>
  <p class="BUT"> Though to catch my drift he's striving,
    I'll dissemble—I'll dissemble;
    When he sees at what I'm driving,
    Let him tremble—let him tremble!
  </p>
  </p>
  <p class="speech">
    ENSEMBLE

    Though a mystic tone { I } borrow,
    you
    You will } learn the truth with sorrow,
    I shall
    Here to-day and gone to-morrow;
    Yes, I know—
    That is so!
    [At the end exit LITTLE BUTTERCUP
    melodramatically.

    CAPT. Incomprehensible as her utterances are, I nevertheless
    feel that
    they are dictated by a sincere regard for me. But to what new
    misery is
    she referring? Time alone can tell!
  </p>
  <p>
    Enter SIR JOSEPH

    SIR JOSEPH. Captain Corcoran, I am much disappointed with your
    daughter. In fact, I don't think she will do.
    CAPT. She won't do, Sir Joseph!
    SIR JOSEPH. I'm afraid not. The fact is, that although I have
    urged my
    suit with as much eloquence as is consistent with an official
    utterance,
    I have done so hitherto without success. How do you account for
    this?
    CAPT. Really, Sir Joseph, I hardly know. Josephine is of course
    sensible of your condescension.
    SIR JOSEPH. She naturally would be.
    CAPT. But perhaps your exalted rank dazzles her.
    SIR JOSEPH. You think it does?
    CAPT. I can hardly say; but she is a modest girl, and her
    social
    position is far below your own. It may be that she feels she is
    not
    worthy of you.
    SIR JOSEPH. That is really a very sensible suggestion, and
    displays
    more knowledge of human nature than I had given you credit for.
    CAPT. See, she comes. If your lordship would kindly reason with
    her and
    assure her officially that it is a standing rule at the Admiralty
    that
    love levels all ranks, her respect for an official utterance
    might induce
    her to look upon your offer in its proper light.
    SIR JOSEPH. It is not unlikely. I will adopt your suggestion.
    But soft,
    she is here. Let us withdraw, and watch our opportunity.

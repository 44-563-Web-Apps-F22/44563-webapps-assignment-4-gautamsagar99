    <h3>ACT: II - Night , Scene: QUARTER-DECK OF H.M.S. PINAFORE, OFF PORTSMOUTH</h3>
    <p>Same Scene. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN
        discovered
             singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
        mandolin. LITTLE
             BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
        him.
      <p class="song">
                                  SONG—CAPTAIN
      
                            Fair moon, to thee I sing,
                              Bright regent of the heavens,
                            Say, why is everything
                              Either at sixes or at sevens?
                            I have lived hitherto
                              Free from breath of slander,
                            Beloved by all my crew—
                              A really popular commander.
                            But now my kindly crew rebel,
                              My daughter to a tar is partial,
                            Sir Joseph storms, and, sad to tell,
                              He threatens a court martial!
                               Fair moon, to thee I sing,
                                 Bright regent of the heavens,
                               Say, why is everything
                                 Either at sixes or at sevens?
      </p>
      <p>
              BUT. How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the
        unconscious
        moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may
        be! Who is
        poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall
        on one so
        lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!
              CAPT. <p class="directions">(coming down).</p> Ah! Little Buttercup, still on board?
        That is
        not quite right, little one. It would have been more respectable
        to have
        gone on shore at dusk.
              BUT, True, dear Captain—but the recollection of your sad
        pale
        face seemed to chain me to the ship. I would fain see you smile
        before I
        go.
              CAPT. Ah! Little Buttercup, I fear it will be long before I
        recover my accustomed cheerfulness, for misfortunes crowd upon
        me, and
        all my old friends seem to have turned against me!
              BUT, Oh no—do not say "all", dear Captain. That were
        unjust to
        one, at least.
              CAPT. True, for you are staunch to me. <p class="directions"> (Aside.)</p> If ever I
        gave my
        heart again, methinks it would be to such a one as this! <p class="directions">(Aloud.)</p> 
        I am
        touched to the heart by your innocent regard for me, and were we
        differently situated, I think I could have returned it. But as it
        is, I
        fear I can never be more to you than a friend.
              BUT, I understand! You hold aloof from me because you are
        rich and
        lofty—and I poor and lowly. But take care! The poor bumboat
        woman has
        gipsy blood in her veins, and she can read destinies.
              CAPT. Destinies?
              BUT. There is a change in store for you!
              CAPT. A change?
              BUT. Aye—be prepared!

                           DUET—LITTLE BUTTERCUP and CAPTAIN
      
         <h5 class="butname">BUT, </h5>         Things are seldom what they seem,
                       Skim milk masquerades as cream;
                       Highlows pass as patent leathers;
                       Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.
          <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5> <p class="directions">(puzzled).</p> Very true,
                           So they do.
          <h5 class="butname">BUT. </h5>        Black sheep dwell in every fold;
                       All that glitters is not gold;
                       Storks turn out to be but logs;
                         Bulls are but inflated frogs.
         <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>  <p class="directions">(puzzled).</p>  So they be,
                            Frequentlee.
         <h5 class="butname">BUT.</h5>          Drops the wind and stops the mill;
                       Turbot is ambitious brill;
                       Gild the farthing if you will,
                       Yet it is a farthing still.
          <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5> <p class="directions">(puzzled).</p> Yes, I know.
                           That is so.
                       Though to catch your drift I'm striving,
                         It is shady—it is shady;
                       I don't see at what you're driving,
                         Mystic lady—mystic lady.
          <p class="directions">(Aside.)</p>     Stern conviction's o'er me stealing,
                       That the mystic lady's dealing

          <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>        Though I'm anything but clever,
                       I could talk like that for ever:
                       Once a cat was killed by care;
                       Only brave deserve the fair.
                               Very true,
                               So they do.
         <h5 class="capname">CAPT.</h5>         Wink is often good as nod;
                       Spoils the child who spares the rod;
                       Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers;
                       Dogs are found in many mangers.

                               I agree.
                       Paw of cat the chestnut snatches;
                       Worn-out garments show new patches;
                       Only count the chick that hatches;
                       Men are grown-up catchy-catchies.

          CAPT. Incomprehensible as her utterances are, I nevertheless
        feel that
        they are dictated by a sincere regard for me. But to what new
        misery is
        she referring? Time alone can tell!
      </p>
      <p>
                                    Enter SIR JOSEPH
      
          SIR JOSEPH. Captain Corcoran, I am much disappointed with your
        daughter. In fact, I don't think she will do.
          CAPT. She won't do, Sir Joseph!
          SIR JOSEPH. I'm afraid not. The fact is, that although I have
        urged my
        suit with as much eloquence as is consistent with an official
        utterance,
        I have done so hitherto without success. How do you account for
        this?
          CAPT. Really, Sir Joseph, I hardly know. Josephine is of course
        sensible of your condescension.
          SIR JOSEPH. She naturally would be.
          CAPT. But perhaps your exalted rank dazzles her.
          SIR JOSEPH. You think it does?
          CAPT. I can hardly say; but she is a modest girl, and her
        social
        position is far below your own. It may be that she feels she is
        not
        worthy of you.
          SIR JOSEPH. That is really a very sensible suggestion, and
        displays
        more knowledge of human nature than I had given you credit for.
          CAPT. See, she comes. If your lordship would kindly reason with
        her and
        assure her officially that it is a standing rule at the Admiralty
        that
        love levels all ranks, her respect for an official utterance
        might induce
        her to look upon your offer in its proper light.
          SIR JOSEPH. It is not unlikely. I will adopt your suggestion.
        But soft,
        she is here. Let us withdraw, and watch our opportunity.
